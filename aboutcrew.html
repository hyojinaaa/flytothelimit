								<h2>Finn McCool</h2>
								<p>Stunt pilot with the Red Arrows (UK airforce stunt team), has served in combat choppers in 3 recent wars, and fears nothing except small dogs and single women. Owns an Extra EA-200 fot the ultimate full stunt flight experience, and flies all our other fixed wing craft much more sedately when required. And, yes, that is his real name. He's Irish and he doesn't want to talk about it.</p>

								<h2>John "Doc" Holiday</h2>
								<p>With over 10,000 hours piloting helicopters in the bush and mountains of the Southern Alps for deer recovery and mountain rescue operations, Doc is well qualified to land you and your friends in remote parts of the country that only he knows about.

								<a class="close"href="#">x</a>
								<h2>Hans Gerhansen</h2>
								<p>Hans has flown almost everything there is to fly. He first took the controls of a small plane at 12 years old, and flew solo when he was 14. After a few years flying "anything, anywhere" he settled into a series of test pilot jobs, but left that because he prefers company when he's in the air. Hans doesn't actually own his own plane right now, unless you count the microlight, but you will find him in the pilot's seat of any of our aircraft. When he's not skiing, tramping, climbing, hang gliding, or performing with his backup band at a local hotel.</p>
